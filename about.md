We are Rhacklette, previously known as WoSec ZH, a group of female, inter, non-binary, trans and agender (FINTA) people in Security. 

Our goal is to create a protected space for gender minorities in the security industry, this applies to professionals as well as students or career changers. We want to create a network, mainly in Switzerland, where people feel safe and understood. A safe space to learn together, in which knowledge is imparted and built up. Where you can have fun together and meet other people who share the same passion.

We are planning some activities for our members, stay tuned for more info to come!
