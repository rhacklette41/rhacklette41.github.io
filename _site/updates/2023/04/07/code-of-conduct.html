<hr />
<p>We, Rhacklette, previously known as WoSec ZH, are committed to creating a safe and respectful space for all members of our community. As a group of female, intersex, non-binary, trans and agender (FINTA) people in Security, our goal is to provide a protected space for gender minorities in the security industry, including professionals, students, and career changers.

We will investigate all complaints promptly and take appropriate action to ensure the safety and well-being of all members. We also encourage all members to be mindful of their language and behavior, and to promote a culture of respect and inclusivity in the community.</p>
