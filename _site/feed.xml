        <title>Code of Conduct</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;code-of-conduct-for-rhacklette&quot;&gt;Code of Conduct for Rhacklette&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, Rhacklette, previously known as WoSec ZH, are committed to creating a safe and respectful space for all members of our community. As a group of female, intersex, non-binary, trans and agender (FINTA) people in Security, our goal is to provide a protected space for gender minorities in the security industry, including professionals, students, and career changers. We want to create a network in Switzerland where people feel safe, understood, and supported. We value diversity and aim to build a community where everyone can learn, have fun, and share their passion for security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that our community remains a safe and inclusive space for everyone, we have established the following terms of conduct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respectful Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All members of Rhacklette are expected to treat each other with respect and dignity. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or bullying based on gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by law. We expect all members to communicate with each other in a professional and respectful manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidentiality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand that many members of our community may be working on sensitive projects or have access to confidential information. Therefore, we expect all members to respect each otherâ€™s privacy and to maintain confidentiality as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection of Minorities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhacklette is committed to protecting the rights and safety of all members, especially those from minority communities. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or bullying based on gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by law. We encourage all members to report any instances of discrimination, harassment, or bullying to the Rhacklette leadership team. We will investigate all complaints promptly and take appropriate action to ensure the safety and well-being of all members. We also encourage all members to be mindful of their language and behavior, and to promote a culture of respect and inclusivity in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participation in CTFs with Rhacklette CTF team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhacklette CTF team activities are exclusive to members of the Rhacklette community. To ensure fairness, all members who participate in Rhacklette CTF activities are expected to follow the rules and regulations set forth by Rhacklette CTF team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workshops/presentations for Rhacklette members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We organize workshops/presentations for Rhacklette members to improve our skills in the security industry. We expect all members who attend these events to be respectful to the presenters and to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Networking events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We organize networking events both internally and with external partners. We expect all members who attend these events to be respectful to each other and to represent Rhacklette positively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly Dinner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We organize monthly dinners for members of Rhacklette. We expect all members who attend these events to be respectful to each other and to communicate with each other in a professional and respectful manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliance with Laws&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All members of Rhacklette are expected to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;consequences-of-violating-the-terms-of-conduct&quot;&gt;Consequences of Violating the Terms of Conduct&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violations of the terms of conduct will not be tolerated. Depending on the severity of the violation, Rhacklette may take disciplinary action, including but not limited to, warning, suspension, or termination of membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that these terms of conduct will help create a safe and respectful environment for all members of Rhacklette. We value diversity and are committed to building a community where everyone can learn, have fun, and share their passion for security.&lt;/p&gt;
